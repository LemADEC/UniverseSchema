	<!--
	  An astronomical object or celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure in the observable universe.
	  They can be a planet, a more abstract construct like solar system (space dimension) or the all mighty hyperspace.
	  Hyperspace is defined by its WarpDriveHyperspace dimension provider.
	  Space is a dimension with Hyperspace as its parent.
	  
	  This default configuration is fairly simple.
	  In practice, you can have several hyperspaces containing multiple spaces containing numerous planets, etc..
	  
	  When no dimension is defined, a celestial object is considered 'virtual'. An hyperspace can be virtual. A sun is (in most cases) virtual.
	  In theory, multiple planets can exists in the same Minecraft world (for example: The Twilight Forest exist on multiple planets in different star systems).
	  
	  celestialObject.id should be unique for each Celestial object.
	  When provided by WarpDrive, this is the world folder name instead of DIMxxx.

		  size defines the world border size, measured in blocks. This is also the size of the orbit area in space, so don't go too big.
		  name defines an optional display name for the player HUD. It defaults to the celestialObject's id. 
		  description defines an optional text displayed on the player HUD.
		  name and description support colors with § or & as the escape code. '\n' is also supported.
		  nbt defines a JSON string for custom tags. It's used by WarpDrive extensions.

		  dimension defines an actual game world. If it's missing, that celestialObject remains visible but you can't "land" on it.  
		  dimension.id: this is the id of the dimension. 0 is the Overworld, -1 is the Nether, 1 is the End.
		  dimension.isBreathable: this is a boolean flag defining if ambient atmosphere is breathable.
		  dimension.isHyperspace: this is a boolean flag defining if this an hyperspace dimension. 
		  dimension.gravity: this is the gravity simulation type. Valid keywords are 'none' (0.0), 'legacySpace', 'legacyHyperspace', 'normal' (1.0) or any value between 0 and 1.
		  dimension.center.x, dimension.center.z: those are the center coordinate of that dimension world border, measured in blocks. For convenience, it's usually 0, 0.

			  provider defines how the world biomes are generated. If it's missing, the mod tries to self-assign space and hyperspace dimensions.
			  provider.type: this is the provider type. Valid keywords are "auto", "WarpDriveSpace", "WarpDriveHyperspace", "other".
			  Currently only Space and Hyperspace can be provided: use other mods to generate planet world.

		  skybox defines the sky rendering while inside a WarpDrive provided dimensions.
		  Those can be adjusted to your lore: in hyperspace, Babylon 5 is redish, Stargate is bluish, etc.
		  skybox.backgroundColor is self explanatory. Vanilla enforces plain black at max render distance.
		  skybox.starBrightnessBase is the minimum brightness of stars in the sky.
		  skybox.starBrightnessVanilla is how much of the vanilla star brightness is used. Space and hyperspace have no Sun, hence it's a fixed value.
		  skybox.celestialObjectOpacity is used for that eery feeling. 0 will completely hide celestial objects.
		  skybox.fogColor is the main color. Higher values increases the halo effect.
		  skybox.fogFactor is the fog opacity depending on local Sun position. Space and hyperspace have no Sun, hence it's a fixed value.
